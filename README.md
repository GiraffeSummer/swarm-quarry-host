# swarm-quarry-host


Originally cloned from https://github.com/dmarcuse/swarm-quarry-host 
Then from https://github.com/Tommsy64/swarm-quarry-host (for the travel queues)
node.js server software for ComputerCraft swarm quarries

Read about setup and usage [here](https://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/25138-nodequarry-a-cheap-scalable-web-based-turtle-quarry/).


Wishlist:
 - travel queues (no more mining up eachother)
 - somewhat proper db (sql / mongo)
 - unique keys (possible overlapping names)
 - turtle info on dashboard (which turtles are assigned, and which are active)
 - better blacklist options
